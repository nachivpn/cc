# Categorical Combinators



* "...roughly  λ-calculus is well-suited for programming, and combinators (of Curry, or those introduced here) 
allow for implementations getting rid of some difficulties in the scope of variables. 
Indeed we intend to develop implementations of functional programming languages based 
on categorical combinators, which we introduce now, letting them arise from the known 
principle that a formal semantic description yields a compilation."—P.L.Curien on Typed Categorical Combinatory Logic
